# Cursor Rules Guide

Rules provide system-level instructions to Agent. They bundle prompts, scripts, and more together, making it easy to manage and share workflows across your team.

## Types of Rules

Cursor supports four types of rules:

| Type | Location | Scope | Use Case |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Project Rules** | `.cursor/rules` | Current project | Version-controlled, scoped to codebase |
| **User Rules** | Cursor Settings | Global | Personal preferences, communication style |
| **Team Rules** | Cursor Dashboard | Team-wide | Organizational standards (Team/Enterprise plans) |
| **AGENTS.md** | Project root | Current project | Simple markdown alternative |

## How Rules Work

Large language models don't retain memory between completions. Rules provide persistent, reusable context at the prompt level.

When applied, rule contents are included at the start of the model context. This gives the AI consistent guidance for generating code, interpreting edits, or helping with workflows.

## Project Rules

Project rules live in `.cursor/rules` as markdown files and are version-controlled. They are scoped using path patterns, invoked manually, or included based on relevance.

### Rule File Structure

Each rule is a markdown file that you can name anything you want. Cursor supports `.md` and `.mdc` extensions. Use `.mdc` files with frontmatter to specify `description` and `globs` for more control over when rules are applied.

```
.cursor/rules/
  react-patterns.mdc       # Rule with frontmatter (description, globs)
  api-guidelines.md        # Simple markdown rule
  frontend/                # Organize rules in folders
    components.md
```

### Rule Types

Control how rules are applied from the type dropdown which changes properties `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`:

| Rule Type | Description | Configuration |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Always Apply** | Apply to every chat session | `alwaysApply: true` |
| **Apply Intelligently** | When Agent decides it's relevant based on description | `alwaysApply: false`, `description` set |
| **Apply to Specific Files** | When file matches a specified pattern | `globs: ["**/*.scala"]` |
| **Apply Manually** | When @-mentioned in chat (e.g., `@my-rule`) | `alwaysApply: false`, no globs |

### Rule File Format

Each rule is a markdown file with frontmatter metadata and content:

```markdown
---
description: "This rule provides standards for frontend components and API validation"
alwaysApply: false
globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.ts"]
---

...rest of the rule content
```

### Creating a Rule

Create rules using the `New Cursor Rule` command or going to `Cursor Settings > Rules, Commands`. This creates a new rule file in `.cursor/rules`.

## Best Practices

Good rules are focused, actionable, and scoped.

### DO

- **Keep rules under 500 lines**: Split large rules into multiple, composable rules
- **Provide concrete examples**: Include referenced files instead of copying their contents
- **Be specific**: Write rules like clear internal docs, avoid vague guidance
- **Reuse rules**: When repeating prompts in chat, create a rule
- **Reference files**: Use `@filename.ts` instead of copying code—keeps rules short and prevents staleness

### DON'T

- **Copy entire style guides**: Use a linter instead. Agent already knows common style conventions.
- **Document every possible command**: Agent knows common tools like npm, git, and pytest.
- **Add instructions for edge cases that rarely apply**: Keep rules focused on patterns you use frequently.
- **Duplicate what's already in your codebase**: Point to canonical examples instead of copying code.

**Tip**: Start simple. Add rules only when you notice Agent making the same mistake repeatedly. Don't over-optimize before you understand your patterns.

## Team Rules

Team and Enterprise plans can create and enforce rules across their entire organization from the [Cursor dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=team-content). Admins can configure whether or not each rule is required for team members.

### Benefits

- **Centralized management**: Update rules once and changes are instantly available to all team members
- **Standardization**: Ensure everyone uses consistent coding standards and practices
- **Easy sharing**: No need to distribute files or coordinate updates across the team
- **Access control**: Only team admins can create and modify team rules

### Activation and Enforcement

- **Enable this rule immediately**: When checked, the rule is active as soon as you create it. When unchecked, the rule is saved as a draft.
- **Enforce this rule**: When enabled, the rule is required for all team members and cannot be disabled in their Cursor settings. When not enforced, team members can toggle the rule off.

### Format

- **Plain text**: Team Rules are free-form text. They do not use the folder structure of Project Rules and do not support metadata such as `globs`, `alwaysApply`, or rule types.
- **Where they apply**: When enabled, Team Rules are included in the model context for Agent (Chat) across all repositories and projects for that team.
- **Precedence**: Rules are applied in this order: **Team Rules → Project Rules → User Rules**. All applicable rules are merged; earlier sources take precedence when guidance conflicts.

## AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is a simple markdown file for defining agent instructions. Place it in your project root as an alternative to `.cursor/rules` for straightforward use cases.

Unlike Project Rules, `AGENTS.md` is a plain markdown file without metadata or complex configurations. It's perfect for projects that need simple, readable instructions without the overhead of structured rules.

### Nested AGENTS.md Support

You can place `AGENTS.md` files in any subdirectory of your project, and they will be automatically applied when working with files in that directory or its children:

```
project/
  AGENTS.md              # Global instructions
  frontend/
    AGENTS.md            # Frontend-specific instructions
    components/
      AGENTS.md          # Component-specific instructions
  backend/
    AGENTS.md            # Backend-specific instructions
```

Instructions from nested `AGENTS.md` files are combined with parent directories, with more specific instructions taking precedence.

## User Rules

User Rules are global preferences defined in **Cursor Settings → Rules** that apply across all projects. They are used by Agent (Chat) and are perfect for setting preferred communication style or coding conventions:

```markdown
Please reply in a concise style. Avoid unnecessary repetition or filler language.
```

**Note**: User Rules do not apply to Inline Edit (Cmd/Ctrl+K). They are only used by Agent (Chat).

## Importing Rules

### Remote Rules (via GitHub)

Import rules directly from any GitHub repository you have access to—public or private.

1. Open **Cursor Settings → Rules, Commands**
2. Click `+ Add Rule` next to `Project Rules`, then select Remote Rule (Github)
3. Paste the GitHub repository URL containing the rule
4. Cursor will pull and sync the rule into your project

Imported rules stay synced with their source repository, so updates to the remote rule are automatically reflected in your project.

### Agent Skills

Cursor can load rules from [Agent Skills](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills), an open standard for extending AI agents with specialized capabilities. These imported skills are always applied as agent-decided rules, meaning Cursor determines when they are relevant based on context.

To enable or disable Agent Skills:

1. Open **Cursor Settings → Rules**
2. Find the **Import Settings** section
3. Toggle **Agent Skills** on or off

**Note**: Agent Skills are treated as agent-decided rules and cannot be configured as always-apply or manual rules.

## FAQ

### Why isn't my rule being applied?

Check the rule type. For `Apply Intelligently`, ensure a description is defined. For `Apply to Specific Files`, ensure the file pattern matches referenced files.

### Can rules reference other rules or files?

Yes. Use `@filename.ts` to include files in your rule's context. You can also @mention rules in chat to apply them manually.

### Can I create a rule from chat?

Yes, you can ask the agent to create a new rule for you.

### Do rules impact Cursor Tab or other AI features?

No. Rules do not impact Cursor Tab or other AI features.

### Do User Rules apply to Inline Edit (Cmd/Ctrl+K)?

No. User Rules are not applied to Inline Edit (Cmd/Ctrl+K). They are only used by Agent (Chat).

### Can I migrate rules to skills?

Yes! Cursor 2.4+ includes a built-in `/migrate-to-skills` command that converts:
- **Dynamic rules** (with `alwaysApply: false` and no `globs`) → Standard skills
- **Slash commands** → Skills with `disable-model-invocation: true`

Rules with `alwaysApply: true` or specific `globs` patterns are not migrated, as they have explicit triggering conditions. User rules are also not migrated since they're not stored on the file system.

Type `/migrate-to-skills` in Agent chat to start the migration process.
