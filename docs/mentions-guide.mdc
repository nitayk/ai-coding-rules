# @ Mentions Guide

Navigate suggestions using arrow keys. Press `Enter` to select. If the suggestion is a category like `Files`, the suggestions filter to show the most relevant items within that category.

## @Files & Folders

### Referencing Files

Reference entire files by selecting `@Files & Folders` followed by the filename to search. You can also drag files from the sidebar directly into Agent to add as context.

### Referencing Folders

When referencing folders using `@Folders`, Cursor provides the folder path and overview of its contents to help the AI understand what's available.

**Tip**: After selecting a folder, type `/` to navigate deeper and see all subfolders.

### Context Management

Large files and folders are automatically condensed to fit within context limits. See [file & folder condensation](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/summarization#file--folder-condensation) for details.

## @Code

Reference specific code sections using the `@Code` symbol. This provides more granular control than `@Files & Folders`, letting you select precise code snippets instead of entire files.

## @Docs

The `@Docs` feature lets you use documentation to help write code. Cursor includes popular documentation and you can add your own.

### Using Existing Documentation

Type `@Docs` in chat to see available documentation. Browse and select from popular frameworks and libraries.

### Adding Your Own Documentation

To add documentation not already available:

1. Type `@Docs` and select **Add new doc**
2. Paste the URL of the documentation site

Once added, Cursor reads and understands the documentation, including all subpages. Use it like any other documentation.

Turn on **Share with team** to make documentation available to everyone on your team.

### Managing Your Documentation

Go to **Cursor Settings** > **Indexing & Docs** to see all your added documentation. From here:

- Edit documentation URLs
- Remove documentation you no longer need
- Add new documentation

## Built-in Commands

- **Summarize**: Compress the context window and provide a summary of the conversation.

You can also define [custom commands](/docs/context/commands) to use in the chat.

## Best Practices

### File References

- **Use @Files for entire files**: When you need the full context of a file
- **Use @Code for snippets**: When you only need specific sections
- **Drag and drop**: Quick way to add files from sidebar

### Folder References

- **Use @Folders for context**: When you need to understand a directory structure
- **Navigate deeper**: Type `/` after selecting a folder to see subfolders
- **Large folders**: Automatically condensed to fit context limits

### Documentation

- **Add team docs**: Share documentation with your team using "Share with team"
- **Keep docs updated**: Remove outdated documentation
- **Use popular docs**: Cursor includes many popular frameworks automatically
