# Go Testing Patterns Index

**Purpose**: Router for Go testing patterns - detects keywords and routes to specific pattern files.

**Chaining**: Router → Category Index → Language Index → This Index (Router) → Files

**Graph Structure**: This is a Layer 1 node that routes to Layer 0 leaves (rule files) based on keywords.
