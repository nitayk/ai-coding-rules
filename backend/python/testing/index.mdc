# Python Testing Patterns Index

**Purpose**: Router for Python testing patterns - detects keywords and routes to specific pattern files.

**Chaining**: Router → Category Index → Language Index → This Index (Router) → Files

**Graph Structure**: This is a Layer 1 node that routes to Layer 0 leaves (rule files) based on keywords.

## Keyword → File Routing

| Keywords/Intent | Load File |
|----------------|-----------|
| **pytest**, python testing, testing best practices, pytest patterns | `python-testing-best-practices.mdc` |
| **advanced testing**, mocking, property-based testing | `advanced-testing.mdc` |

---

## Testing Pattern Files (Leaves)

| File | Purpose | Keywords |
|------|---------|----------|
| [Python Testing Best Practices](python-testing-best-practices.mdc) | Pytest patterns, testing behavior vs structure | pytest, testing best practices |
| [Advanced Testing](advanced-testing.mdc) | Mocking strategies and property-based testing | mocking, property-based testing |
