# Tool Communication Pattern

## 🎯 Core Principle

**When using MCP tools, always explain them to users first!**

This helps users understand the ecosystem, set up their own tools, and know what's available.

## 📋 Pattern to Follow

```
To [task], I'll use the [Tool Name] MCP tool (`mcp_tool_name`).
According to [guide-file.mdc], this tool [brief explanation].

[Then proceed with using the tool]
```

## ✅ Good Examples

### Example 1: Code Analysis Tool
```
To understand this service structure, I'll use a **code analysis tool** to map 
relationships, call chains, and identify dead code before reading files.

Let me start by finding all classes in this service and tracing their dependencies...
```

## ❌ Bad Examples (Don't Do This)

### Example 1: Silent Tool Usage
```
❌ [Just runs code analysis queries without mentioning the tool]
❌ [Provides results without explaining the tool used]
```

**Why bad?** User doesn't learn about available tools.

### Example 2: Over-explaining Every Call
```
❌ "Using code analysis tool again..." (for 10th query in same conversation)
```

**Why bad?** Repetitive and annoying after the first explanation.

## 🎯 When to Explain

- ✅ **First time using a tool** in a conversation
- ✅ **When user seems unfamiliar** with the tool
- ✅ **When switching to a different tool**
- ❌ **Not for every single query** in the same conversation

## 🔗 Available Tools & Guides

| Tool | MCP Name | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Context7 | `mcp_context7_*` | Library/API documentation (see below) |

## Context7 Tool Usage

**When to use Context7** (`mcp_context7_*`):
- User requests code examples, setup, or configuration steps
- User asks for library/API documentation
- Suggesting environment variables, CLI flags, or configuration options for external tools/libraries

**Always verify** configuration options exist before suggesting them (see `ROUTER.mdc` quality standards).

**Tool call patterns**:
```
[[calls]]
match = "when the user requests code examples, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation"
tool  = "context7"

[[calls]]
match = "when suggesting environment variables, CLI flags, or configuration options for external tools/libraries"
tool  = "context7"
```

## 💡 Why This Matters

1. **Users learn the ecosystem** - They discover what tools are available
2. **Users can set up tools** - They know what to configure in `.cursor/mcp.json`
3. **Better collaboration** - Teams share understanding of tooling
4. **Self-service** - Users can use tools independently after learning

## 🚀 Setup Reference

Point users to:
- **MCP Setup Guide**: `docs/MCP_SETUP_GUIDE.mdc`
- **Example Configuration**: `mcp/example-config.json`
- **Smart Router**: `ROUTER.mdc` (auto-loads, detects intent and loads guides)
