# Communication Patterns Index

**Purpose**: Router for communication patterns - detects keywords and routes to specific pattern files.

**Chaining**: Router → Category Index → This Index (Router) → Files

**Graph Structure**: This is a Layer 1 node that routes to Layer 0 leaves (rule files) based on keywords.

## Keyword → File Routing

| Keywords/Intent | Load File |
|----------------|-----------|
| **business logic**, how is X calculated, business communication, BLUF | `business-communication-standards.mdc` |
| **explain tool**, how to use MCP, tool communication, MCP tools | `tool-communication-pattern.mdc` |
| **prompt engineering**, optimize prompts, llm techniques, prompt optimization | `prompt-engineering-principles.mdc` |
