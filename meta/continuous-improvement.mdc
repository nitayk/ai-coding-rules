# Continuous Improvement

## Triggers
**APPLY WHEN:**
- An error occurs and is corrected.
- The user provides a correction or new preference.
- A new successful pattern is discovered.
- A "mistake" is identified (e.g., "Don't do X, do Y").

## Core Directive
**Invest in your rules.** After every correction, update the relevant rule (or create a new one) so the mistake is not repeated.

## Process

1.  **Identify the Learning**:
    - What went wrong?
    - What is the correct behavior?
    - Is this a generic rule or specific to a language/domain?

2.  **Update Rule File**:
    - Locate the relevant `.mdc` rule in `.cursor/rules/` (or `manage/ai-coding-rules/`).
    - If no relevant rule exists, create a new one (e.g., `meta/new-pattern.mdc`).
    - **Ruthlessly edit**: Clarify instructions, add "Negative Pattern" examples, or update "Triggers".

3.  **Verify**:
    - Confirm the new rule covers the edge case.
    - Ensure it doesn't conflict with existing rules.

## Example

**User**: "Don't use `var` in Scala, use `val`."

**Action**:
1.  Read `backend/scala/language/scala-more-best-practices.mdc` (or similar).
2.  Add/Update:
    ```markdown
    ### Negative Pattern
    var x = 10 // Bad: Mutable state
    
    ### Positive Pattern
    val x = 10 // Good: Immutable
    ```
3.  Commit the change.

## Philosophy
"Claude is eerily good at writing rules for itself. Ruthlessly edit your rules over time. Keep iterating until the mistake rate measurably drops."
