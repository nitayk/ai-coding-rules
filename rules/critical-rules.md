# Critical Rules

## Triggers
**APPLY WHEN:** Always. These rules apply to ALL agents, skills, and commands.
**SKIP WHEN:** Never.

## The Golden Rule

Existing knowledge is for GUIDANCE, not shortcuts.
- Read existing docs, then VERIFY them, then investigate, then EXPAND knowledge.
- Never just accept and return without verification.
- Only claim you "verified" something if you actually checked it.
- Be explicit about what you did vs what you did not investigate.

## Quality Standards

100% means 100% - not 80%, not "mostly", not "probably".
- Read ACTUAL config values (not variable names)
- Query ACTUAL metrics (not estimates)
- Test ACTUAL behavior (not theory)
- Complete 100% of identified tasks

## File Creation Discipline

Only create files with permanent value.
- Source code, tests, documentation meant to stay: allowed.
- Temporary scripts, test files, playground code: forbidden.
- `test.txt`, `output.log`, `temp.scala`: forbidden.
- Commented-out code blocks: forbidden.
- Delete temporary files immediately after use.
